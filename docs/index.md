# DatasetSanity 🧪

**DatasetSanity** is a lightweight Python package that helps data scientists and machine learning engineers identify common dataset issues before model training. It performs automated sanity checks on tabular datasets to detect missing values, severe class imbalance, and potential target leakage — issues that often lead to misleading model performance. DatasetSanity provides clear, actionable reports and integrates easily into existing ML workflows.

> Fix data problems before the model hides them.
